# Expanding-Cards

- In this project, i'm going to build some expanding cards, basically i was going to style these panels to have a background image and a heading.
- I'm going to use flex blocks to align everything and then add a little bit of JavaScript so that when we click one of these, it changes the class to active and it then expands with the CSS transition
case.
- I'll be using JavaScript for the eventlistener, will be using CSS transitions to give it the smooth through the fact you'll see the heading doesn't come in until the card is fully expanded as well.
